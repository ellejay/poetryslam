    "May a windless bower be built,",
    "Far from passion, pain and guilt,",
    "In a dell mid lawny hills,",

    "In their whisperings musical",
    "The inspired soul supplies",

    "And the love which heals all strife",
    "Circling, like the breath of life,",
    "All things in that sweet abode",
    "With its own mild brotherhood:",
    "They, not it, would change; and soon",

    "Beneath whose shade all life is wither'd up,",
    "And the fair oak, whose leafy dome affords",
    "A temple where the vows of happy love",
    "Are register'd, are equal in thy sight:",
    "No love, no hate thou cherishest; revenge",
    "And favouritism, and worst desire of fame",
    "Thou know'st not: all that the wide world contains",
    "Are but thy passive instruments, and thou",
    "Regard'st them all with an impartial eye,",
    "Whose joy or pain thy nature cannot feel,",
    "Because thou hast not human sense,",
    "Because thou art not human mind.",
    "\"Yes! when the sweeping storm of time",
    "Has sung its death-dirge o'er the ruin'd fanes",
    "And broken altars of the almighty Fiend",
    "Whose name usurps thy honours, and the blood",
    "Through centuries clotted there has floated down",
    "The tainted flood of ages, shalt thou live",
    "Unchangeable! A shrine is rais'd to thee,",
    "Which, nor the tempest-breath of time,",
    "Nor the interminable flood",
    "Over earth's slight pageant rolling,",
    "Availeth to destroy\u2014",
    "The sensitive extension of the world.",
    "That wondrous and eternal fane,",
    "Where pain and pleasure, good and evil join,",
    "To do the will of strong necessity,",
    "And life, in multitudinous shapes,",
    "Still pressing forward where no term can be,",
    "Like hungry and unresting flame",
    "Curls round the eternal columns of its strength.\""
